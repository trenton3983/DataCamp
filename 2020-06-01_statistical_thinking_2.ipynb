    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of statistical inference will be provided. Building on the foundations from [Part 1](https://trenton3983.github.io/posts/statistical-thinking-1/), your ability to estimate parameters and conduct hypothesis tests using real-world data sets will be enhanced. Hands-on analysis, including the study of beak measurements of Darwin's finches, will solidify your skills. By the end of the course, you'll be equipped with advanced tools and practical experience to confidently approach and solve your own data inference challenges.\n",

    "- Ohio and Pennsylvania are similar states.\n",

    "- I hypothesize that country-level voting in these two states have identical probability distributions.\n",

    "- The _hypothesis we are testing_ is typically called the _**null hypothesis**_.\n",
    "- We might start by just plotting the two ECDFs of county-level votes.\n",
    "- Based on the graph below, it's pretty tough to make a judgment.\n",

    " - We could just compare some summary statistics.\n",
    "   - An answer is still not clear.\n",
    "   - The means and medians of the two states are really close, and the standard deviations are almost identical.\n",
    "  - Eyeballing the data is not enough to make a determination.\n",
    "- To resolve this issue, we can simulate what the data would look like if the country-level voting trends in the two states were identically distributed.\n",
    "- We can do this by putting the Democratic share of the vote for all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties and Ohio's 88 counties together.\n",
    "- We then ignore what state they belong to.\n",
    "- Next, randomly scramble the ordering of the counties.\n",
    "- We then re-label the first 67 to be Pennsylvania and the remaining to be Ohio.\n",
    "- We we just redid the election as if there was no difference between Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permutation\n",
    "- This technique, of scrambling the order of an array, is called permutation.\n",
