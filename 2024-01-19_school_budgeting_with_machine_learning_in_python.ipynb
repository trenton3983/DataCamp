    "# Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. You'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, you'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, you'll do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, you'll have the opportunity to try your own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, you'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case study discusses the use of several types of models for a school budgeting problem with machine learning in Python. The models used include:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Multi-class logistic regression: This is used as a starting point to quickly go from raw data to predictions. The model treats each label column independently and trains a logistic regression classifier for each label column separately.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. Random Forest Classifier: This model is mentioned as a possible choice to use in a scikit-learn Pipeline for classification. It's known for its performance and ease of use in classification tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. Naive Bayes Classifier: This is another type of model that could be used in a scikit-learn Pipeline. It is based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier: This model is listed as an alternative that could be experimented with in the pipeline. It classifies data based on the closest training examples in the feature space.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. Ensemble methods: The document also alludes to the use of ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy. Specifically, it mentions the winner of a competition using an ensemble of many models for classification.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. Deep Convolutional Neural Network: It is indicated that the winner of a machine learning competition mentioned in the case study used a 500-layer deep convolutional neural network to master the budget data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These models are typical in machine learning tasks that involve classification and pattern recognition. They were chosen for their effectiveness in dealing with the specific characteristics of the school budget data, such as its multi-class nature and the presence of both numerical and textual data."

    "\n",
    "1. Introducing the challenge: Hello DataCampers! How's it going? Really glad you've decided to join us for this course. We have an exciting journey ahead of us through some real data and some incredibly useful tips and tricks from expert data scientists. I'm Peter Bull, a data scientist and a co-founder of DrivenData. Our mission is to bring the power of data science to social impact organizations. One of the ways we do that is by running online data science challenges for non-profits, NGOs, and social enterprises. In our challenges, a global community of data scientists--like you!--competes to solve a particular problem. We'll work\n",

    "  - Feature engineering\n",
    "  - Efficency boosting hashing tricks\n",
    "- Use data to have a social impact\n",
    "2. Introducing the challenge: through one of these competitions as a case-study, and we'll show you how the winner achieved the best score. In the course, we'll do some natural language processing, some feature engineering, and boost our computational efficiency. In addition to these pro-tips, we'll look at one of the ways in which we can use data to have a social impact.\n",
    "- Budgets for schools are huge, complex, and not standardized\n",
    "  - Hundreds of hours each year are spent manually labelling\n",
    "- Goal: Build a machine learning algorithm that can automate the process\n",
    "- Budget data\n",
    "  - Line-item: \"Algebra books for 8th grade students\"\n",
    "  - Labels: \"Textbooks\", \"Math\", \"Middle School\"\n",
    "- This is a supervised learning problem\n",
    "3. Introducing the challenge: School budgets in the United States are incredibly complex, and there are no standards for reporting how money is spent. Schools want to be able to measure their performance--for example, are we spending more on textbooks than our neighboring schools, and is that investment worthwhile? However to do this comparison takes hundreds of hours each year in which analysts hand-categorize each line-item. Our goal is to build a machine learning algorithm that can automate that process. For each line item, we have some text fields that tell us about the expense--for example, a line might say something like \"Algebra books for 8th grade students\". We also have the amount of the expense in dollars. This line item then has a set of labels attached to it. For example, this one might have labels like \"Textbooks,\" \"Math,\" and \"Middle School.\" These labels are our target variable. This is a supervised learning problem where we want to use correctly labeled data to build an algorithm that can suggest labels for unlabeled lines. This is in contrast to an unsupervised learning problem where we don't have labels, and we are using an algorithm to automatically which line-items might go together. For this problem,\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Over 100 target variables!: we have over 100 unique target variables that could be attached to a single line item. Because we want to predict a category for each line item, this is a classification problem. This is as opposed to a regression problem where we want to predict a numeric value for a line item--for example, predicting house prices. Here are some of the actual categories that we need to determine: Is this expense for\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Over 100 target variables!: pre-kindergarten education (which is important because it has different funding sources)? Or, is there a particular\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Over 100 target variables!: Student_Type that this expense supports? Overall, there are 9 columns with many different possible categories in each column.\n",

    "7. How we can help: If you talk to the people who actually do this work, it is impossible for a human to label these line items with 100% accuracy. To take this into account, we don't want our algorithm to just say \"This line is for textbooks.\" We want it to say: \"It's most likely this line is for textbooks, and I'm 60% sure that it is. If it's not textbooks, I'm 30% sure it's 'office supplies.'\" By making these suggestions, analysts can prioritize their time. This is called a human-in-the-loop machine learning system.\n",

    "## Exploring the data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exploring the data: We left off the last video by showing that we'd be predicting probabilities for each budget line item. Let's be clear what this looks like in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A column for each possible value: or example, we'll say we are predicting the hair type and eye color of people. We have the categories \"curly,\" \"straight,\" and \"wavy\" for hair and \"brown\" and \"blue\" for eyes. If we are predicting probabilities, we need a value for each possible value in each column. In this case, the target would have the columns for each hair type and for each eye color. Later in the course, we'll talk more about how to perform this transformation. We'll begin by loading our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load and preview the data: As an example, in this video we'll work with a small sample dataset. For the exercises, you'll be loading the actual school budget dataset. You've seen pandas functions for loading data before, and in this case we'll be working with a file of comma-separated values: a CSV. First, we'll import pandas giving it the alias pd so we don't have to type pandas every time we want to use a function. We'll use the function read_csv and pass the filename to our dataset. Then, the function head shows us the first 5 rows of the DataFrame and the column names. We can see this sample dataset has both numeric data and text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Summarize the data: The function info tells us a bit more information about our dataset. Importantly, it tells us the datatype of each column. Columns that can be recognized as a numeric type--integers and floats--will be recognized as such. Columns that can't will get the generic type of object. Additionally, info tells us if any of the columns have missing values. As we can see, the column with_missing has 95 non-null entries, which means that there are 5 rows that are missing a value in the with_missing column. The next summary function we want to use is describe. This function gives us summary statistics of numeric columns in our data frame. In addition to also giving us a hint about missing values with count, we can get a sense for the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Let's practice!: Now it's your turn to load the actual dataset we'll be working with using read_csv and then look at what it contains with the functions head, info, and describe."

    "## Looking at the datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the datatypes: We've seen we have some numeric values and some text values in our dataset. It's common to have data where each value is from a known set of categories. For example, a column season_of_year may have the values winter, spring, summer, and fall. These kinds of data are not simply strings. Let's look at\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Objects instead of categories: our sample dataset again. If we look at the label column, we can see that it takes either the value a or the value b. We can treat these kinds of variables in a way that solves two problems for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encode labels as categories: The first problem is that our machine learning algorithms work on numbers. We need a numeric representation of these strings before we can do any sort of model-fitting. The second problem is that strings can be slow. We never know ahead of time how long a string is, so our computers have to take more time processing strings than numbers, which have a precise number of bits. In pandas, there is a special datatype called category that encodes our categorical data numerically, and--because of this numerical encoding--it can speed up our code. In pandas, we can call the astype function with the string category to change a column's type from object to category. Here are two rows of the 'label' column from the sample dataframe. When the data is loaded, pandas assumes that these variables are strings, so the dtype is object. By calling astype('category'), we are returned a categorical variable. As we can see, pandas is already smarter about the values that appear in the column--in this case, the two values a and b.### Slide 5: Dummy variable encoding. We have actually converted these strings into a numeric representation of the categories.\n",
    "- ML algorithms work on numbers, not strings\n",

    "- Strings can be slow compared to numbers\n",
    "- In pandas, `category` dtype encodes categorical data numerically\n",
    "  - Can speed up code\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dummy variable encoding: To see this numeric representation, we can use the get_dummies function in pandas. This is called get_dummies because this process is called creating \"dummy variables\". Our dummy variables dataframe has two columns: the first, if the value is \"label_a,\" the second if the value is \"label_b.\" Each row contains a 1 if that row is of that category, and a 0 if not. This is also called a \"binary indicator\" representation. Note that the prefix_sep parameter is useful to tell the get_dummies function what character should separate the original column name and the column value for our dummy variable. Before we create categorical representations of our budget data, we want to mention\n",
    "- Also called a `binary indicator` representation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lambda functions: lambda functions, a feature of the Python language. Instead of using the def syntax you may have seen before, lambda functions let you make simple, one-line functions. For example, we may want a function that squares a variable. We can define a lambda function that takes a parameter, the variable x. The function itself just multiplies x by x and returns the result. We can call this function just like any other Python function, and it returns whatever the one line of code evaluates to.\n",
    "- Alternative to `def` syntax\n",
    "- Easy way to make simple, one-line functions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Encode labels as categories: In the sample dataframe, we only have one relevant column called label. But, you'll remember from looking at the budget data that there are multiple columns we want to make categorical. To make multiple columns into categories, we need to apply the function to each column separately. We will use a small lambda function to convert each column to a category. We then use the apply method on a pandas dataframe to apply this function to each of the relevant columns separately by passing the axis equals 0 parameter. Now it's your turn to use astype('category')\n",
    "- In the sample dataframe, we only have one relevant column\n",
    "- In the budget data, there are multiple columns that need to be made categorical\n",

    "## How do we measure success?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we measure success?: The next step is to decide how we decide if our algorithm works. Choosing how to evaluate your machine learning model is one of the most important decisions an analyst makes. The decision balances the real-world use of the algorithm, the mathematical properties of the evaluation function, and the interpretability of the measure. How do we measure success?: Often we hear the question \"how accurate is your model?\" Accuracy is a simple measure that tells us what percentage of rows we got right. However, sometimes accuracy doesn't tell the whole story. Consider the case of identifying spam emails. Let's say that only 1% of the emails I receive are spam. The other 99% are legitimate emails. I can build a classifier that is 99% accurate just by assuming every message is legitimate, and never marking any message as spam. But this model isn't useful at all because every message, even the spam, ends up in my inbox. The metric we use for this problem is called log loss. Log loss is what is generally called a \"loss function,\" and it is a measure of error. We want our error to be as small as possible, which is the opposite of a metric like accuracy, where we want to maximize the value.\n",
    "- Accuracy can be misleading when classes are imbalanced\n",
    "  - Legitimate email: 99%, Spam: 1%\n",
    "  - Model that never predicts spam will be 99% accurate!\n",
    "- Metric used in this problem: log loss\n",
    "It is a loss function\n",
    "  - Measure of error\n",
    "  - Want to minimize the error (unlike accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Log loss binary classification: Let's look at how logloss is calculated. It takes the actual value, 1 or 0, and it takes our prediction, which is a probability between 0 and 1. The greek letter sigma (which looks like an uppercase E below) indicates that we're taking the sum of the logloss measures for each row of the dataset. We then multiply this sum by -1 over N, the number of rows, to get a single value for loss. We will unpack this math a little more by looking at an example. Consider the case where the true label is 0, but we predict confidently that the label is 1. In this case, because y is 0, the first term becomes 0. This means the logloss is calculated by (1 - y) times log(1 - p). This simplifies to log(1 - 0-point-9) or log(0-point-1), which is 2-point-3. Now, Log loss binary classification: example: consider the case that the correct label is 1, but our model is not sure and our prediction is right in the middle (0-point-5). Our logloss is 0-point-69. Since We are trying to minimize log loss, we can see that it is better to be less confident than it is to be confident and wrong.\n",
    "- Log loss for binary classi,cation\n",
    "  - ![][sb5]\n",
    "- Actual value: y = {1=yes, 0=no}\n",
    "- Prediction (probability that the value is 1): p\n",
    "- Try label is 0, but we predict confidently that the label is 1\n",
    "  - logloss = (1 - y) * log(1 - p)\n",
    "  - logloss = (1 - 0) * log(1 - 0.9)\n",
    "  - logloss = 2.3\n",
    "- Try label is 1, but our model is not sure and our prediction is right in the middle (0.5)\n",
    "  - logloss = -1/N * sum(y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p))\n",
    "  - lobloss = 0.69\n",
    "  - Better to be less confident than to be confident and wrong\n",
    "3. Computing log loss with NumPy: Here is an implementation of logloss. The most important detail is the clip function which sets a maximum and minimum value for the elements in an array. Since log(0) is negative infinity, we want to offset our predictions ever so slightly from being exactly 1 or exactly 0 so that our score remains a real number. In this example we use the eps variable to be 0-point-00 (thirteen zeros) 1, which is close enough to zero to not effect our overall scores. After adjusting the predictions slightly with clip, we calculate logloss using the formula. If we call this function on the examples we looked at earlier, we can see that the confident and wrong item returns the expected value of 2-point-3 and the prediction that is right in the middle returns 0-point-69. We have implemented it here to demonstrate how to take a mathematical equation and turn it into a function to use for evaluation, just like you may need to if you were participating in a machine learning competition.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It's time to build a model: When approaching a machine learning problem, and in particular looking at a dataset from a machine learning competition, it's always a good approach to start with a very simple model. Creating a simple model first helps to give us a sense of how challenging a question actually is. Before we dig deep into complex models where many more things can go wrong, we want to understand how much signal we can pull out using basic methods. We'll start with a model that just uses the numeric data columns. In building our first model, we want to go from raw data to predictions as quickly as possible. In this case, we'll use multi-class logistic regression, which treats each label column as independent. The model will train a logistic regression classifier for each of these columns separately and then use those models to predict whether the label appears or not for any given rows. After writing out our predictions to a CSV, we'll simulate submitting them to the competition and seeing what our score would be.\n",

    "  - Train classifier of each label separately and use those to predict\n",
    "- Format predictions and save to CSV\n",
    "- Compute log loss score of your predictions\n",
    "2. Splitting the multi-class dataset: In the supervised learning course, we talked about splitting our data into a training set and a test set. However, because of the nature of our data, the simple approach to a train-test split won't work. Some labels that only appear in a small fraction of the dataset. If we split our dataset randomly, we may end up with labels in our test set that never appeared in our training set. Our model won't be able to predict a class that it has never seen before! One approach to this problem is called StratifiedShuffleSplit, which is mentioned in the supervised learning course. However, this scikit-learn function only works if you have a single target variable. In our case, we have many target variables. To work around this issue, we've provided a utility function, multilabel_train_test_split, that will ensure that all of the classes are represented in both the test and training sets. We'll have a link to that code in the exercises if you're curious.\n",
    "- Recall: Train-test split\n",
    "  - Will not work here\n",
    "  - May end up with labels in test set that never appear in training set\n",
    "- Solution: `StratifiedShuffleSplit`\n",
    "  - Only works with a single target variable\n",
    "  - We have many target variables\n",
    "  - `multilabel_train_test_split()`\n",
    "3. Splitting the data: First, we'll subset our data to just the numeric columns. NUMERIC_COLUMNS is a variable we provide that contains a list of the column names for the columns that are numbers rather than text. Then we'll do a minimal amount of preprocessing where we fill the NaNs that are in the dataset with -1000. In this case, we choose -1000, because we want our algorithm to respond to NaN's differently than 0. We'll create our array of target variables using the get_dummies function in pandas. Again, the get_dummies function takes our categories, and produces a binary indicator for our targets, which is the format that scikit-learn needs to build a model. Finally, we use the multilabel_train_test_split function that is provided to split the dataset in to a training set and a test set.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data_to_train = df[NUMERIC_COLUMNS].fillna(-1000)\n",
    "labels_to_use = pd.get_dummies(df[LABELS])\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = multilabel_train_test_split(\n",
    "    data_to_train,\n",
    "    labels_to_use,\n",
    "    size=0.2, seed=123)\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Training the model: Now we can import our standard LogisticRegression classifier from sklearn dot linear_model. We'll also import the OneVsRestClassifier from the sklearn dot multiclass module. OneVsRest let's us treat each column of y independently. Essentially, it fits a separate classifier for each of the columns. This is just one strategy you can use if you have multiple classes. Take a look at the scikit-learn documentation for other strategies you could consider. Now we can train that classifier by calling fit and passing our features in X_train and the corresponding labels that are in y_train.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\n",
    "clf = OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression())\n",
    "clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `OneVsRestClassifier`:\n",
    "  - Treats each column of y independently\n",
    "  - Fits a separate classifier for each of the columns\n",
    "5. Let's practice!: Now it's your turn to build a model and make some predictions!"

    "1. Making predictions: Once our classifier is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data. We could use our test set that we've withheld, but we want to simulate actually competing in a data science competition,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Predicting on holdout data: so we will make predictions on the holdout set that the competition provides. As we did with our training data, we load the holdout data using the read_csv function from pandas. We then perform the same simple preprocessing we used earlier. First, we select just the numeric columns. Then we use fillna to replace NaN values with -1000.Finally, we call the predict_proba method on our trained classifier. Remember, we want to predict probabilities for each label, not just whether or not the label appears. If we simply used the predict method instead, we would end up with a 0 or 1 in every case. Because log loss penalizes you for being confident and wrong, the score for this submission would be significantly worse than if we use predict_proba.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "houldout = pd.read_csv('HoldoutData.csv', index_col=0)\n",
    "holdout = holdout[NUMERIC_COLUMNS].fillna(-1000)\n",
    "predictions = clf.predict_proba(holdout)\n",

    "  - would result in an output of 0 or 1\n",
    "  - Log loss penalized being confident and wrong\n",
    "  - Worse performance compared to `.predict_proba()`\n",
    "3. Submitting your predictions as a csv: In data science competitions, it's a standard practice to write your predictions as a CSV and then upload that CSV to the competition platform. From the competition documentation, we can see that the submission format for this competition expects a dataframe that has each of the individual labels as the column headers and probabilities for each of the columns. The to_csv function on a DataFrame, will take our predictions and write them out to a file. One quick note: you'll notice that our columns have the original column name separated from the value by two underscores. This is because some of the column names already contained single a underscore.\n",

    "    - Each row is a prediction for that label\n",
    "    - Write to a file\n",
    "4. Format and submit predictions: The predictions that were generated by predict_proba is just an array of values. It doesn't have column names or an index like our submission format does. We'll fix this by turning those values into a DataFrame. To get the column names, we use get_dummies on our target variables and then borrow those column names for our new dataframe. Our index will be the same index that we read into pandas with read_csv, and the data is the predictions themselves. As we noted in the previous slide, we want to separate the original column names from the column values with a double underscore when we call get_dummies. To do this, we will use the keyword argument prefix_sep equals double underscore with the get_dummies function. Finally, we can call to_csv and pass the filename of the file we want to write out to disk. We can call the score_submission function that is provided to see how our submission would have scored in the competition!\n",

We would generate a score for you on the holdout set and then post that score to the leaderboard. Here is an example of the leaderboard from this competition. As the competition proceeds, people make more and more submissions and their place on the leaderboard changes as they build better and better models.\n",

    "## A very brief introduction to NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A very brief introduction to NLP: Some of our data comes in the form or freefrom text. When we have data that is text, we often want to process this text to create features for our algorithms. This is called Natural Language Processing, or NLP. We'll cover a couple of basic techniques for processing text data. A very brief introduction to NLP: Data for natural language processing can be text, as it is in our case, entire documents (for example, magazine articles or emails), or transcriptions of human speech (like the script I'm reading for this video!). The first step in processing this kind of data is called \"tokenization\". Tokenization is the process of splitting a long string into segments. Usually, this means taking a string and splitting it into a list of strings where we have one string for each word. For example, we might split the string \"Natural Language Processing\" into a list of three separate tokens: \"Natural,\" \"Language,\" and \"Processing\".\n",
    "- Data for NLP:\n",
    "  - Text, documents, speech, ...\n",
    "- Tokenization\n",
    "  - Splitting a string into segments\n",
    "  - Store segments as list\n",
    "- Example: \"Natural Language Processing\"\n",
    "  - `['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing']`\n",
    "2. Tokens and token patterns: Let's take a look at an example of actual data from our school budget dataset. We have the full string \"PETRO-VEND FUEL AND FLUIDS.\" If we want to tokenize on whitespace, that is split into words every time there is a space, tab, or return in the text, we end up with 4 tokens. The token \"PETRO-VEND,\" the token \"FUEL,\" the token \"AND,\" and the token \"FLUIDS.\" For some datasets, we may want to split words based on other characters than whitespace. For example, in this dataset we may observe that often we have words that are combined with a hyphen, like \"PETRO-VEND.\" We can opt in this case to tokenize on whitespace and punctuation. Here we break into tokens every time we see a space or any mark of punctuation. In this case, we end up with 5 tokens: The token \"PETRO,\" the token \"VEND,\" the token \"FUEL,\" the token \"AND,\" and the token \"FLUIDS.\" Now that we have our 5 tokens, we want to use them as part of our machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "- Tokenize on whitespace\n",
    "  - Petro-vend fuel and fluids\n",
    "    - Petro-vend | fuel | and | fluids\n",
    "- Tokenize on whitespace and punctuation\n",
    "  - Petro | vend | fuel | and | fluids\n",
    "3. Bag of word presentation: Often, the first way to do this is to simply count the number of times that a particular token appears in a row. This is called a \"bag of words\" representation, because you can imagine our vocabulary as a bag of all of our words, and we just count the number of times a particular word was pulled out of that bag. If you're following along closely, you may have noticed that this approach discards information about word order. That is, the phrase \"red, not blue\" would be treated the same as \"blue, not red.\" A slightly more sophisticated approach is to create what are called\n",
    "- Count the number of times a particular token appears\n",
    "- \"Bag of words\"\n",
    "  - Count the number of times a word was pulled out of the bag\n",
    "- This approach discards information about word order\n",
    "  - \"Red, not blue\" is the same as \"blue, not red\"\n",
    "4. 1-gram, 2-gram, …, n-gram: \"n-grams.\" In addition to a column for every token we see, which is called a \"1-gram,\" we may have a column for every ordered pair of two words. In that case, we'd have a column for \"PETRO-VEND,\" a column for \"VEND FUEL,\" a column for \"FUEL AND,\" and a column for \"AND FLUIDS.\" These are called 2-grams (or bi-grams). N can be any number, for example, we may also include 3-grams (or tri-grams) in this example. There are three columns for trigrams: one column for \"PETRO-VEND FUEL,\" one for \"VEND FUEL AND,\" and one for \"FUEL AND FLUIDS.\" Now it's time for a little practice with tokenization and n-grams.\n",

    "1. Representing text numerically: Let's talk about how we take the tokenizations we have created and turn them into an array that we can feed into a machine learning algorithm. We mentioned the bag-of-words representation in our last video. This is one of the simplest ways to represent text in a machine learning algorithm. It discards information about grammar and word order, just assuming that the number of times a word occurs is enough information.\n",

    "  - Computes frequency of occurrence\n",
    "2. Scikit-learn tools for bag-of-words: Scikit-learn provides a very useful tool for creating bag-of-words representations. It is called the CountVectorizer. The CountVectorizer works by taking an array of strings and doing three things. First, it tokenizes all of the strings. Then, it makes note of all of the words that appear, which we call the \"vocabulary\". Finally, it counts the number of times that each token in the vocabulary appears in every given row.\n",
    "- `CountVectorizer()`\n",
    "  - Tokenizes all the strings\n",
    "  - Builds a 'vocabulary'\n",
    "  - Counts the occurrences of each token in the vocabulary\n",
    "3. Using `CountVectorizer()` on column of main dataset: The `CountVectorizer` is part of the text submodule in the feature_extraction module in scikit-learn. After importing the CountVectorizer, we will define a regular expression that does a split on whitespace. We won't go into the details here of how this regular expression works, but there are great resources for learning regular expressions online. We'll also make sure that our text column does not have any NaN values, simply replacing those with empty strings instead. Finally, we'll create a CountVectorizer object where we pass in the token_pattern that we have created. This creates an object that we can use to create bag-of-words representations of text. The `CountVectorizer` object that we've created can be used with the fit and transform pattern, just like any other preprocessor in scikit-learn. fit will parse all of the strings for tokens and then create the vocabulary. Here, we use the word vocabulary specifically to mean all of the tokens that appear in this dataset. transform will tokenize the text and then produce the array of counts. As part of the exercises, we'll look at how changing our token_pattern will change the number of tokens that the CountVectorizer recognizes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVecotrizer\n",

Each step is represented with a name for the step, that is simply a string, and an object that implements the fit and the transform methods. A good example is the `CountVectorizer` that we used earlier. As we'll see Pipelines are a very flexible way to represent your workflow. In fact, you can even have a sub-pipeline as one of the steps!

    "1. **Text features and feature unions**: In this video, we'll look at how we process text data in a pipeline and then how we put it all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing text features**: Our sample dataframe contains one column we haven't used yet, the text column. First, we'll change our train and test data just to be working with the text data for now. Then, we'll add a step to our Pipeline with the name vec and the CountVectorizer object from scikit-learn. Now our pipeline will use the CountVectorizer on our dataset, and then it will pass the result into our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
    "print('accuracy on sample data: ', accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preprocessing multiple dtypes**: Let's say we want to use all of our data in a single pipeline. We can't just have a Pipeline that has a `CountVectorizer` step, Imputation step, and then a classifier. The `CountVectorizer` won't know what to do with the numeric columns, and we don't want to perform imputation on the text columns. In order to build our pipeline, we need to separately operate on the text columns and on the numeric columns. There are two tools: FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion that will help us build a Pipeline to work with both our text and numeric data. The first utility that we cover is the FunctionTransformer.\n",
    "- Want to use all available features in one pipeline\n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "  - Pipeline steps for numeric and text preprocessing can't follow each other\n",
    "  - e.g., output of `CountVectorizer` can't be input to `Imputer`\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "  - `FunctionTransformer()` & `FeatureUnion()`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **FunctionTransformer**: `FunctionTransformer` has a simple job: take a Python function, and turn it into an object that the scikit-learn Pipeline can understand. We'll write two simple functions: one that takes the whole dataframe, and returns just the numeric columns. The other will take the whole dataframe and return just the text columns. Using these function transformers, we can build a separate Pipeline for our numeric data and for our text data.\n",
    "- Turns a Python function into an object that a scikit-learn pipeline can understand\n",

    "  - Take entire DataFrame, return text columns\n",
    "- Can then preprocess numeric and text data in separate pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Putting it all together**: First, we'll do our train_test split on the entire dataset and import the FunctionTransformer and FeatureUnion utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df[['numeric','with_missing', 'text']], pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), random_state=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Putting it all together**: Next, we'll create two `FunctionTransformer` objects. The first takes a dataframe and just returns the column named 'text'. The second takes a dataframe and returns the columns named 'numeric' and 'with_missing'. These two function transformer objects will let us set up separate Pipelines that operate on the selected columns only. Note that we've passed the parameter validate equals False. This simply tells scikit-learn it doesn't need to check for NaNs or validate the dtypes of the input. We'll do that work ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "get_text_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x['text'], validate=False)\n",
    "get_numeric_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x[['numeric', 'with_missing']], validate=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: `FeatureUnion` from the sklearn dot pipeline module is the other utility we need. We know that our text pipeline generates the array on the left, our text features.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: And our numeric pipeline generates the array on the right, our numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **FeatureUnion Text and Numeric Features**: The FeatureUnion object puts these two sets of features together as a single array that will be the input to our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n",
    "union = FeatureUnion([('numeric', numeric_pipeline), ('text', text_pipeline)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Putting it all together**: Here's our entire pipeline, which processes our text and numeric data. First, we create our separate text and numeric pipelines. Remember, `get_numeric_data` and `get_text_data` are the `FunctionTransformers` that we just created. These pipelines output our numeric features and our text features respectively. Then we create our overall pipeline, which has two steps: First, the `FeatureUnion` takes a list of objects, calls each one, and then concatenates the output into a wide array out of all the results. In this case, it will call our numeric pipeline and then our text pipeline. Once we have this array of all of our features, we can pass it to our classifier. We can call fit and score on this pipeline, just like our simpler ones before it.\n",

In the sample dataset, there was only one text column. This is the format that `CountVectorizer` expects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main dataset: lots of text**: However, our main dataset has 14 text columns. In an interactive exercise during our NLP chapter we wrote a function combine_text_columns that put together all the text columns into a single column. We'll re-use this function as part of our Pipeline to process the text in the budget dataset.\n",

Hopefully, this is starting to feel familiar.\n",

The beauty of this code, is that it has one change from the code we used for the sample dataset: we create a `FunctionTransformer` object using our combine_text_columns function instead of the simple selection function we used in the sample dataset. Other than this one change, the pipeline that processes the text, imputes the numeric columns, joins those results together and then fits a multilabel logistic regression remains the same.\n",

While some of this may be new, some of it may be familiar from this course or other work you've done on DataCamp. By knowing which tools to combine, we can build extremely effective models.\n",

    "- Statistical methods\n",

    "3. Learning from the expert: text preprocessing: In our introduction to natural language processing, we introduced the same tools that the winner used. These are common tools for manipulating text, and are often effective for improving models based on text data. The first trick the winner used was to tokenize on punctuation. By noticing that there are lots of characters like hyphens, periods, and underscores in the text we are working with, the winner picked out a better way of separating words than just spaces. The other trick was to use a range of n-grams in the model. By including unigrams and bigrams, the winner was more likely to capture important information that appears as multiple tokens in the text--for example, \"middle school.\"\n",
    "- NLP tricks for text data\n",
    "  - Tokenize on punctuation to avoid hyphens, underscores, etc.\n",
    "  - Include unigrams and bi-grams in the model to capture important information involving multiple tokens (e.g., \"middle school\")\n",
    "4. N-grams and tokenization: One of the massive benefits of building our models on top of scikit-learn is that many of these common tools are implemented for us and are well-tested by a large community. To change our tokenization and add bi-grams, we can change our call to `CountVectorizer`. We'll pass the regular expression to only accept alphanumeric characters in our tokens. We defined this expression back in chapter 2. We'll also add the parameter `ngram_range` equals (1, 2). This tells the `CountVectorizer` to include 1-grams and 2-grams in the vectorization. These changes to the call to `CountVectorizer` are the only changes we need to make to add these preprocessing steps. We can easily update our pipeline to include this change, which will be part of the exercises.\n",

    "5. Range of n-grams in scikit-learn: Then we fit our updated pipeline in the same way that we've been doing throughout the course: call the fit method on our Pipeline object. Getting predictions from our model is also the same as it has been throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Range of n-grams in scikit-learn: We use the predict_proba function to get our class probabilities.

However, what if terms are not next to each other? For example, consider \"English Teacher for 2nd Grade\" and \"2nd Grade - budget for English Teacher\". If I want to identify this line item as a staff position for an elementary school, it helps to know that both \"2nd grade\" and \"English teacher\" appear. Interaction terms let us mathematically describe when tokens appear together.\n",
    "- Statistical tool that the winner used: interaction terms\n",
    "- Example\n",

This new column, X3, has its own coefficient, Beta 3, which can separately measure how important it is that X1 and X2 appear together. Again,\n",
    "- ![][sb2]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Adding interaction features with scikit-learn**: scikit-learn provides us with a straightforward way of adding interaction terms. In scikit-learn this functionality is called `PolynomialFeatures`, and we import it from the sklearn dot preprocessing module. As an example, we'll show the same x matrix as the last slide. When we create a `PolynomialFeatures` we tell it the degree of features to include. In our example, we looked at multiplying 2 columns together to see if they co-occurred, so degree equals 2, however, you could 3, 4, or more. While this can sometimes improve the model results, adding larger degrees very quickly scales the number of features outside what is computationally feasible. The `interaction_only` equals True parameter tells `PolynomialFeatures` that we don't need to multiply a column by itself, and we'll talk about include_bias on the next slide. When we fit and transform our array, x, we can see that we get the expected output from the last slide with the new column added. We opted not to include a bias term in our model, but you could have if you wanted to. A bias term is an offset for a model.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",

    "       [1., 1., 1.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. **A note about bias terms**: For example, if we plot age on the x-axis, and weights on the y-axis, we'd have a line that had a value 7-point-5 lbs when the baby is born, because a baby has a weight even when it is 0 years old! A bias term allows your model to account for situations where an x value of 0 should have a y value that is not 0, like in this example.\n",
    "- Bias term allows your model to have non-zero y value when x is 0\n",
    "- ![][sb3]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Sparse interaction features**: As we mentioned, adding interaction terms makes your X array grow exponentially. Because of computational concerns, our `CountVectorizer` returns an object called a sparse matrix. We won't dig into the details here, but the standard `PolynomialFeatures` object is not compatible with a sparse matrix. We provide you with a replacement, `SparseInteractions` which works with a sparse matrix. You only need to pass it the `degree` parameter for it to work in the same way.\n",

    "1. Learning from the expert: the winning model: Congratulations! You've implemented nearly all of the winning pipeline. Just a couple more tweaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learning from the expert: hashing trick: We've mentioned that we need to balance adding new features with the computational cost of additional columns. For example, adding 3-grams or 4-grams is going to have an enormous increase in the size of the array. As the array grows in size, we need more computational power to fit our model. The \"hashing trick\" is a way of limiting the size of the matrix that we create without sacrificing too much model accuracy. A hash function takes an input, in this case a token, and outputs a hash value. For example, the hash value may be an integer like in this example below. We explicitly state how many possible outputs the hashing function may have. For example, we may say that we will only have 250 outputs of the hash function. The `HashingVectorizer` then maps every token to one of those 250 columns. Some columns will have multiple tokens that map to them. Interestingly, the original paper about the hashing function demonstrates that even if two tokens hash to the same value, there is very little effect on model accuracy in real world problems.\n",

    "- Hashing is a way of increasing memory efficiency\n",
    "  - ![][sb4]\n",
    "- Hash function limits possible outputs, fixing array size\n",
    "3. When to use the hashing trick: We've been working with a small subset of the data for this course, however, the size of the full dataset is part of the challenge. In this situation, we want to do whatever we can to make our array of features smaller. Doing so is called \"**dimensionality reduction**\". The hashing trick is particularly useful in cases like this where we have a very large amount of text data.\n",

    "4. Implementing the hashing trick in scikit-learn: Implementing the hashing trick is very simple in scikit-learn. Instead of using the `CountVectorizer`, which creates the bag of words representation, we change to the `HashingVectorizer`. We can pass this the same `token_pattern` and `ngram_range` as before. The parameters norm equals None and non_negative equals `True` let you drop in the `HashingVectorizer` as a replacement for the `CountVectorizer`. For more details on those two parameters, you can see the scikit-learn documentation. We can now use the `HashingVectorizer` in a `Pipeline` instead of the `CountVectorizer`.\n",

    "5. The model that won it all: We've worked through the three categories of tools that the winner put together to win the competition. The NLP trick was to use bigrams and tokenize on punctuation. The statistical trick was to add interaction terms to the model. The computational trick was to use a `HashingVectorizer`. You can now code all of these in a scikit-learn Pipeline. However, there's one thing we haven't talked about yet. What is the class of model that the winner used? Was it a deep convolutional neural network? Extreme gradient boosted trees? An ensemble of local-expert elastic net regressions?\n",

    "- What class of model was used?\n",
    "6. The model that won it all: No! The winning model was, in fact, the simple model we started with: **logistic regression**! The competition wasn't won by a cutting edge algorithm. Instead, it was won by thinking carefully about how to create features for the model and then adding a couple of easily implemented tricks. So, instead of reaching for those advanced algorithms that are hard to interpret and expensive to train, it's always worth it to see how far you can get with simpler methods.\n",

Your new skills have the ability to really make a difference. The volume of data is growing everywhere, not only in the tech industry. And with this growth in data comes opportunity: the opportunity to use your data science skills to make people's lives better.\n",

    "2. Can you do better?: One of our goals has been to demonstrate how flexible and powerful the Pipeline API is in scikit-learn. We've successively added small code changes that have had a big effect on our model. Now we want you to think about how you might improve things. Some areas to look at might be: Including stemming or stop-word removal in your natural language processing. Trying a different class of model like RandomForest, KNN or Naive Bayes. Doing further processing on the numeric columns and handling NaNs differently than the default Imputer. One of the benefits of scikit-learn is GridSearch (as you learned about in the supervised learning course). Check out the scikit-learn documentation to see how to perform grid search over every object in a Pipeline. You could even look around the scikit-learn docs and experiment with a new technique you haven't used before. Feel free to sign up on DrivenData and experiment with some of these methods on the full dataset. Learning how these approaches effect real-world data can be a huge boost to your skills.\n",
