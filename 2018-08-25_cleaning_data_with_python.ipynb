    "It's now time to deal with the missing data. There are several strategies for this: You can drop them, fill them in using the mean of the column or row that the missing value is in (also known as [imputation](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)), or, if you are dealing with time series data, use a forward fill or backward fill, in which you replace missing values in a column with the most recent known value in the column. See [pandas Foundations](#https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations) for more on forward fill and backward fill.\n",

    "In general, it is not the best idea to drop missing values, because in doing so you may end up throwing away useful information. In this data, the missing values refer to years where no estimate for life expectancy is available for a given country. You could fill in, or guess what these life expectancies could be by looking at the average life expectancies for other countries in that year, for example. Whichever strategy you go with, it is important to carefully consider all options and understand how they will affect your data.\n",
