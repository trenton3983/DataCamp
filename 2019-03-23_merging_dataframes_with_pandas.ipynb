    "As a Data Scientist, you'll often find that the data you need is not in a single file. It may be spread across a number of text files, spreadsheets, or databases. You want to be able to import the data of interest as a collection of DataFrames and figure out how to combine them to answer your central questions. This course is all about the act of combining, or merging, DataFrames, an essential part of any working Data Scientist's toolbox. You'll hone your pandas skills by learning how to organize, reshape, and aggregate multiple data sets to answer your specific questions."

    "#### Concatenating vertically to get MultiIndexed rows\n",
    "\n",
    "When stacking a sequence of DataFrames vertically, it is sometimes desirable to construct a MultiIndex to indicate the DataFrame from which each row originated. This can be done by specifying the ```keys``` parameter in the call to ```pd.concat()```, which generates a hierarchical index with the labels from ```keys``` as the outermost index label. So you don't have to rename the columns of each DataFrame as you load it. Instead, only the Index column needs to be specified.\n",
