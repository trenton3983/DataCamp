    "\n",
    "When displaying a 2-D array with `plt.imshow()` or `plt.pcolor()`, the values of the array are mapped to a corresponding color. The set of colors used is determined by a colormap which smoothly maps values to colors, making it easy to understand the structure of the data at a glance.\n",

    " * Another four colormaps are based on the seasons, namely `'summer'`, `'autumn'`, `'winter'` and `'spring'`.\n",
    " * You can insert the option `cmap=<name>` into most matplotlib functions to change the color map of the resulting plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will explore four different colormaps together using `plt.subplot()`. You will use a pregenerated array `Z` and a meshgrid `X`, `Y` to generate the same filled contour plot with four different color maps.
