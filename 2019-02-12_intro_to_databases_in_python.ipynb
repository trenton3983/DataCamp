Then, you use this **Table** object to read your table from the engine and autoload the columns. Using the **Table** object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments **autoload=True** and **autoload_with=engine** to **Table()**.\n",

To work around that issue, you can get blocks of rows from the ResultProxy by using the **.fetchmany()** method inside a loop. With **.fetchmany()**, give it an argument of the number of records you want. When you reach an empty list, there are no more rows left to fetch, and you have processed all the results of the query. Then you need to use the **.close()** method to close out the connection to the database.\n",
