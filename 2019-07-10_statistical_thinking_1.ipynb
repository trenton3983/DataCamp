    "\n",
    "For the exercises in this section, you will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. The full data set is [available as part of scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html). Here, you will work with his measurements of petal length.\n",

    "Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of Iris versicolor using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, you can use `sns.set()`, where `sns` is the alias that `seaborn` is imported as.\n",

    "The subset of the data set containing the Iris versicolor petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array `versicolor_petal_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Justin plotted the histograms by using the `pandas` library and indexing the DataFrame to extract the desired column. Here, however, you only need to use the provided NumPy array. Also, Justin assigned his plotting statements (except for `plt.show()`) to the dummy variable `_`. This is to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed. It is not required for your solutions to these exercises, however it is good practice to use it. Alternatively, if you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a `;` after your plotting statements to achieve the same effect. Justin prefers using `_`. Therefore, you will see it used in the solution code.\n",

    "You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to ***np*** approximates a Binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability ***p*** of success (with ***n*** large and ***p*** small). Importantly, the Poisson distribution is often simpler to work with because it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have talked about probabilities of discrete quantities, such as die rolls and number of bus arrivals, but what about continuous quantities?  A continuous quantity can take on any value, not just discrete ones.  For example, the speed of a train can be 45.76 km/h.  Continuous variables also have probability distributions.  Let's consider an example.  In 1879, Albert Michelson performed 100 measurements of the speed of light in air.  Each measurement has some error in it; conditions, such as temperature, humidity, alignment of his optics, etc., change from measurement to measurement.  As a result, any fractional value of the measured speed of light is possible, so it's apt to describe the results with a continuous probability distribution.  In looking at Michelson's numbers, show here in units of 1000 km/s, we see this is the case.  **What probability distribution describes these data?**  I posit, these data follow the **Normal Distribution**.  To understand what the normal distribution is, lets consider its **probability density function** (PDF).  This is the continuous analog to the **probability mass function** (PMF).  ___It describes the chances of observing a  value of a continuous variable___.  The probability of observing a single value of the speed of light, does not make sense, because there is an infinity of numbers, between 299,600 and 300,100 km/s.  Instead, areas under the PDF, give probabilities.  The probability of measuring the speed of light is greater the 300,000 km/s is an area under the normal curve.  Parameterizing the PDF based on Michelson's experiments, this is about a 3% chance, since the pink region is about 3% of the total area under the PDF.  To do this calculation, we were really just looking at the cumulative distribution function (CDF), of the Normal distribution.  Here's the CDF of the Normal distribution.  Remember, the CDF gives the probability, the measured speed of light will be less than the value on the x-axis.  Reading off the value at 300,000 km/s, there is a 97% chance, the speed of light measurement, is less than that.  There's about a 3% chance it's greater.\n",

    "### Introduction to the Normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normal distribution is famous, and we just used it as an example to learn about continuous distributions.  It describes a continuous variable whose PDF is symmetric and has a single peak.  The Normal distribution is parameterized by two parameters.  The **mean** determines where the center of the peak is.  The **standard deviation** is a measure of how wide the peak is, or how spread out the data are.  Note, the mean and standard deviation are the names of the parameters of the Normal distribution.  **Don't confuse these with the mean and standard deviation we computed directly from the data when doing exploratory data analysis**.  The nomenclature is confusing, but it's important to keep straight.  Adding a histogram of the Michelson measurements, shows the measured speed of light in air, looks Normally distributed.  Comparing the histogram to the PDF, suffers from binning bias, therefore, it's better to compare the ECDF of the data, to the theoretical CDF of the Normal distribution.  To compute the theoretical CDF, use `np.random.normal`, to draw samples, then compute the CDF.  As was the case with sampling out of the binomial distribution, we need to provide parameters, in this case, the mean and standard deviation, to parameterize the Normal distribution we are sampling out of.  The mean and standard deviations computed from the data are good estimates, so we'll compute and pass them into `np.random.normal` to take our samples.  We then use the `def ecdf` function we already wrote, to compute the ECDFs of the data and of the Normally distributed theoretical samples we just drew.  Finally, plot the theoretical and empirical CDFs on the same plot.  With the absence of binning bias, it's much clearer that the Michelson data are approximately Normally distributed.  Now that you can sample out of the Normal distribution, let's practice using it.\n",
