    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python."

    "- The art and science of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",

    "  - Your computer can learn to predict whether an email is spam or not spam, given its content and sender.\n",
    "  - Your computer can learn to cluster, say, Wikipedia entries, into different categories based on the words they contain.\n",
    "    - It could then assign any new Wikipedia article to one of the existing clusters.\n",
    "- Note that, in the first example, we are trying to predict a particular class label, the is, spam or not spam.\n",
    "- In the second example, there is not such label.\n",

    "- Example:\n",

    "- Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing.\n",

In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one we will use in this exercise.\n",

Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an `'images'` key in addition to the `'data'` and `'target'` keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this `'images'` key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see [Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python)](https://trenton3983.github.io/files/projects/2020-03-05_intro_to_data_visualization_in_python/2020-03-05_intro_to_data_visualization_in_python.html).

    "- What will our loss function be?\n",

    "- For each data point, calculate the vertical distance between it and the line.\n",
    "  - This distance is called a residual.\n",
    "- We could try to minimize the sum of the residuals, but then a large positive residual would cancel out a large negative residual.\n",
    "  - For this reason, **we minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals**.\n",

    "- It isn't easy to see in two dimensions, but when there are many features, this is, if the data sit in a high-dimensional space with large coefficients, it gets easy to predict nearly anything.\n",
    "- For this reason, it's common practice to alter the loss function, so it penalizes for large coefficients.\n",
    "  - This is called _**Regularization**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge regression**\n",
    "- The first type of regularized regression that we'll look at, is called _ridge regression_, in which out loss function is the standard _OLS_ loss function, plus the squared value of each coefficient, multiplied by some constant, $\\alpha$\n",
    "  - $\\text{Loss function}=\\text{OLS loss function}+\\alpha*\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}^2$\n",
    "  - Thus, when minimizing the loss function to fit to our data, models are penalized for coefficients with a large magnitude: large positive and large negative coefficients.\n",
    "  - Note, $\\alpha$ is a parameter we need to choose in order to fit and predict.\n",
    "  - Essentially, we can select the $\\alpha$ for which our model performs best.\n",
    "  - Picking $\\alpha$ for ridge regression is similar to picking `k` in `KNN`.\n",
    "- This is called _hyperparameter tuning_, and we'll see much more of this in section 3.\n",
    "- This $\\alpha$, which you may also see called $\\lambda$ in the wild, can be thought of as a parameter that controls the model complexity.\n",
    "- Notice when $\\alpha = 0$, we get back $\\text{OLS}$, which can lead to _overfitting_.\n",
    "  - Large coefficients, in this case, are not penalized, and the _overfitting_ problem is not accounted for.\n",
    "- A very high $\\alpha$ means large coefficients are significantly penalized, which can lead to a model that's too simple, and end up _underfitting_ the data.\n",

    "In earlier versions of `scikit-learn`, the `Ridge` regression model included a `normalize` parameter that allowed users to specify whether to normalize the input features before fitting the model. Normalization here refers to scaling individual features to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in more recent versions of `scikit-learn`, this `normalize` parameter has been deprecated. The recommendation now is to use a `StandardScaler` for feature scaling before applying the model, or to use a `Pipeline` to streamline this process. This change promotes a more explicit handling of preprocessing steps, improving code clarity and flexibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Centering and scaling\n",
    "   - Great work on imputing data and building machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn!\n",
    "   - Data imputation is one of several important preprocessing steps for machine learning.\n",
    "   - In this video, will cover another: centering and scaling your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why scale your data?\n",
    "   - To motivate this, let's use `df.describe()` to check out the ranges of the feature variables in the red wine quality dataset.\n",
    "   - The features are chemical properties such as `'acidity'`, `'pH'`, and `'alcohol'` content.\n",
    "   - The target value is good or bad, encoded as '1' and '0', respectively.\n",
    "   - We see that the ranges vary widely: `'density'` varies from (point) 99 to to 1 and `'total sulfur dioxide'` from 6 to 289!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why scale your data?\n",
    "   - Many machine learning models use some form of distance to inform them so if you have features on far larger scales, they can unduly influence your model.\n",
    "   - For example, **K-nearest neighbors uses distance explicitly when making predictions**.\n",
    "   - For this reason, **we actually want features to be on a similar scale**.\n",
    "   - To achieve this, we do what is called normalizing or scaling and centering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ways to normalize your data\n",
    "   - There are several ways to normalize your data:\n",
    "     - given any column, you can subtract the mean and divide by the variance so that all features are centered around zero and have variance one.\n",
    "       - This is called standardization.\n",
    "     - You can also subtract the minimum and divide by the range of the data so the normalized dataset has minimum zero and maximum one.\n",
    "     - You can also normalize so that data ranges from -1 to 1 instead.\n",
    "   - In this video, I'll show you to to perform **standardization**. \n",
    "   - See the scikit-learn docs for how to implement the other approaches."

    "   - You have used these skills to build models using real-world datasets.\n",
