    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned the basics of SQL in our [Intro to SQL for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) course, it's time to supercharge your queries using joins and relational set theory! In this course you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self-joins, semi-joins, anti-joins and cross joins - fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. You'll fear set theory no more, after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will see a visual perspective to grasp the ideas throughout the course using the mediums of Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations."

    "\n",
    "4. **Economies** (general, 2010, 2015 versions)\n",
    "   - **Primary key**: `code` for each version\n",
    "   - **Fields**: `year`, `income_group`, `gdp_percapita` (and other economic indicators depending on the table)\n",
    "   - **Relations**: Linked to `Countries` through `code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Populations**\n",
    "   - **Primary key**: `pop_id`\n",
    "   - **Fields**: `country_code`, `year`, `fertility_rate`, `life_expectancy`, `size`\n",

These constraints would ensure that all references between tables are valid and consistent, preventing orphan records and maintaining referential integrity."

    "\n",
    "- In SQL, a join combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database via a lookup process.\n",
    "- There are four types of joins covered in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of joins:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- INNER JOIN: also denoted as JOIN\n",
    " - Self-joins: special case\n",
    "- OUTER JOIN\n",
    " - LEFT JOIN: also denoted as LEFT OUTER JOIN\n",
    " - RIGHT JOIN: also denoted as RIGHT OUTER JOIN\n",
    " - FULL JOIN: also denoted as FULL OUTER JOIN\n",
    "- CROSS JOIN: create all possible combinations between two tables\n",
    "- Semi-join / Anti-join\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words appearing in ALL capital letters correspond to joins having simple SQL syntax.\n",
    " - Self-joins, semi-joins, and anti-joins don't have built-in SQL syntax.\n",
    "- An INNER JOIN keeps only the records in which the key field (or fields) is in both tables.\n",
    "- A LEFT JOIN keeps all the records in fields specified in the left table and includes the matches in the right table based on the key field or fields.\n",
    " - Key field values that don't match in the right table are included as missing data in the resulting table of a LEFT JOIN.\n",
    "- A RIGHT JOIN keeps all the records specified in the right table and includes the matches from the key field(s) in the left table.\n",
    " - THose that don't match are included as missing values in the resulting table from the RIGHT JOIN query.\n",
    "- A FULL JOIN is a combination of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN showing exactly which values appear in both tables and those that appear in only one or the other table.\n",
    "- A CROSS JOIN matches all records from fields specified in one table with all records from fields specified in another table.\n",
    " - Remember that a `CROSS JOIN` does not have an `ON` or `USING` clause, but otherwise looks very similar to the code for an `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set Theory Clauses**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that `UNION` includes every record in both tables but **DOES NOT** double count those that are in both tables.\n",
    "- `UNION ALL` **does** replicate those that are in both tables.\n",
    "- `INTERSECT` gives only those records found in both of the two tables.\n",
    "- `EXCEPT` gives only those records in one table **but not** the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semi-joins and Anti-joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you'd like to filter your first table based on conditions set on a second table, you should use a semi-join to accomplish the task.\n",
    "- If instead you'd like to filter the first table based on conditions **NOT** being met on a second table, you should use an anti-join.\n",
    " - Anti-joins are particularly useful in diagnosing problems with other joins in terms of getting fewer or more records than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of basic subqueries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most common type of subquery is done inside of a `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "* The next most frequent types of subqueries are inside `SELECT` clauses and inside `FROM` clauses.\n",
    "* Subqueries can also find their way into the ON statement of a join in ways similar to what you've seen inside `WHERE` clauses too."
